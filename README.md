# CodeMeta Website

This website is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  Hugo is a static website engine, which is fast, popular, and easy to install and theme. See the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for a quick orientation on how the site is organized.

Before building the site, you should run the `make` command, in order to download the crosswalk locally; which is used by Hugo to generate the content of crosswalk pages.

Then, at your option:

* To build the site to `../website`, run `hugo`. You may then open that folder in your browser, or
* To previous the site directly without RStudio, run `hugo serve`, which will make the site available at http://localhost:1313/
