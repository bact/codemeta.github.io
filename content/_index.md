## Introducing CodeMeta

Software development creates changes, and scientific research requires
reproducibility. Since software is routinely used in research projects,
this can cause problems.

_**CodeMeta acts as a vital bridge between these disciplines.**_

When used and maintained in code repositories and software distribution
systems, CodeMeta enables the exact version of a library or application,
that has been used and cited in scientific and other research, to be
reliably identified and reused.

Created in 2016 by a consortium of researchers, using existing technologies
such as Schema.org terms and JSON-LD, CodeMeta is now a recognised framework
that is employed by a worldwide community of developers, researchers, and
archivists.

CodeMeta is suggested for use by the following

## Use Cases

Credit
: CodeMeta's _citation_ metadata is useful for ensuring that authors get
credit for their software, when it is used for published research.

Reproducability
: Tracking the software libraries and applications used in research, using
CodeMeta's _versions_ and _dependencies_ metadata, ensures that important
findings can be reviewed and verified with greater accuracy.

Discovery
: Finding software is easier with CodeMeta's _keywords_ and _descriptions_
metadata. These terms allow everyone to discover relevant software, and use
or contribute to it.

## Connecting via Crosswalks

Repositories, software languages, and scientific domains often have different
vocabularies for their metadata. Our Crosswalks exist to provide a reliable
path to interoperability. By mapping each of these formats to CodeMeta via a
Crosswalk, CodeMeta acts as a translation layer for data to be converted
freely, preserving information that would otherwise be lost.
