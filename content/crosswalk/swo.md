The [Software Ontology (SWO)](http://theswo.sourceforge.net/) is a resource for describing software tools, their types, tasks, versions, provenance and data associated.
SWO is part of the JISC funded [SWORD project](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/sword-software-ontology-research-description) (Software Ontology for Resource Description), an inter-disciplinary effort to capture software descriptions used in the preservation of data.
The work is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the University of Manchester.
