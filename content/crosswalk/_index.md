CodeMeta Crosswalks provide an explicit map between the fields of existing
metadata standards, as used by a broad range of software repositories, 
registries, and archives. When mapped by a Crosswalk, CodeMeta's terms act as
a common set of properties, providing a pathway for metadata to be translated
between standards.

Crosswalks are not required to have a one-to-one mapping for every field.
Because Crosswalks only map fields common between a standard and CodeMeta, the
subset of common fields may differ a lot between Crosswalks. The diagram below
demonstrates how CodeMeta maps between standards when there are differences.

### Contribute!

CodeMeta encourages submissions of additional vocabularies. Refer to the
[CodeMeta repository contribution guide](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta?tab=contributing-ov-file#contributing-a-new-mapping)
to submit a new Crosswalks.

Crosswalks are not automatically listed on this website.
[The guide for contributing to this website](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta.github.io?tab=contributing-ov-file#adding-new-crosswalks)
explains how to set that up.

Please feel welcome to propose corrections or extensions in the [CodeMeta issues tracker](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/issues).

## Crosswalk directory

This directory contains many of the available Crosswalks. The full Crosswalk table is
[available as a `.csv`](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/tree/master/crosswalk.csv)
file in the CodeMeta repository.
