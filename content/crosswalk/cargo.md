[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is the Rust package manager.

The `Cargo.toml` file for each package is called its manifest. Cargo uses the metadata in the manifest to download Rust package’s dependencies, compile packages, make distributable packages, and upload them to crates.io, the Rust community’s package registry.

The manifest format is described in [the Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).
