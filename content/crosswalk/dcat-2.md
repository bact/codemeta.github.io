Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web.

[DCAT 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) is superseded by DCAT 3,
but DCAT 3 does not make DCAT 2 obsolete.
DCAT 3 terms preserve backward compatibility with DCAT 2.
