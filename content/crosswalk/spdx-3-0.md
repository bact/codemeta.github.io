The [System Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®)](https://spdx.dev/),
formerly known as the *Software Package Data Exchange*,
is a standard format for communicating information about components associated
with systems.
While traditionally known as "software bill of materials" or "SBOM,"
SPDX 3.0 can describe datasets and be used in non-SBOM contexts.

SPDX 3.0 supports the JSON-LD serialization format and often uses `.spdx.json`,
`.spdx.jsonld`, `.spdx3.json`, or `.spdx3.jsonld` as the file extension.

The crosswalk for the SPDX 3.0 fields is as follows:
