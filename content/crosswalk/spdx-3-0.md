The [System Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®)](https://spdx.dev/),
formerly known as the *Software Package Data Exchange*, specification
defines a standard data format for communicating the component and metadata
information associated with software packages and beyond, widely known as
"software bill of materials" or "SBOM".
An SPDX document can be associated with a set of software packages, files or snippets.
SPDX 3.0 can describe datasets and be used in non-SBOM contexts.

SPDX 3.0 supports JSON-LD serialization format and often uses `.spdx.json`,
`.spdx.jsonld`, `.spdx3.json`, or `.spdx3.jsonld` as the file extension.

The crosswalk for the SPDX 3.0 document as follows:
